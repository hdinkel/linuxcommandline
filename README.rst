The folders ''linux_beginner'' and ''linux_intermediate'' are Re-Writes of the documentation 
which was originally done in Word, converted to ReStructuredText.

Here, we're using `ReStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ for writing, and `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
to convert the Markup into HTML and PDF ("Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation")
