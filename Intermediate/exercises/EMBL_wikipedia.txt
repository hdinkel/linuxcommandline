EMBL

The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) is a molecular biology research institution
supported by 20 European countries and Australia as associate member state. EMBL was created in 1974
and is an intergovernmental organisation funded by public research money from its member states.
Research at EMBL is conducted by approximately 85 independent groups covering the spectrum of
molecular biology. The Laboratory operates from five sites: the main Laboratory in Heidelberg, and
Outstations in Hinxton (the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)), Grenoble, Hamburg, and
Monterotondo near Rome.

Research at EMBL
Each of the sites has a specific research field. The EBI is a hub for bioinformatic research and
services, developing and maintaining a large number of databases which are free of charge for the
scientific community. At Grenoble and Hamburg, research is focused on structural biology. EMBL's
dedicated Mouse Biology Unit is located in Monterotondo. At the headquarters in Heidelberg, there
are units in Cell Biology and Biophysics, Developmental Biology, Genome Biology and Structural and
Computational Biology as well as service groups complementing the aforementioned research fields.

Many scientific breakthroughs have been made at EMBL, most notably the first systematic genetic
analysis of embryonic development in the fruit fly by Christiane NÃ¼sslein-Volhard and Eric
Wieschaus, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1995.

Mission
The cornerstones of EMBL's mission are manifold. Basic research in molecular biology and molecular
medicine is performed; scientists, students and visitors at all levels are trained; vital services
to scientists in the member states are offered; new instruments and methods in the life sciences are
developed; and there is an active engagement in technology transfer.
