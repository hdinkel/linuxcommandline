ToDo:
-----

- Make sure Dan adds /g/software/bin to $PATH
- Make sure Dan adds an editor (gedit)
- Use more "interesting" examples for trivial things such as "sed 's/text/stuff/'"
- as scripting example: Write a script which can extract multiple archive formats, depending on the file ending
- exercises for IO/Redirection/Variables
- add 'pdftotext' to do some text mining?
- Add a file (news? article?) with simple text to show each command (sed, awk, grep)
