About Bio-IT 
-------------

Bio-IT is a community project aiming to develop and strengthen the
bioinformatics user community at EMBL Heidelberg. It is made up of members
across the different EMBL Heidelberg units and core facilities. The project
works to achieve these aims, firstly, by providing a forum for discussing and
sharing information and ideas on computational biology and bioinformatics,
focused on the `Bio-IT portal <http://bio-it.embl.de>`_. Secondly, we organise and
participate in a range of different networking and social activites aiming to
strengthen ties across the community.
